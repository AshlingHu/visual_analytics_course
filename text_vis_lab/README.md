# text_vis_lab

### Background

We have learned basic text processing method in class, check the material 

here. 

In this assignment, we are going to use a data set from Vox News, including articles before March, 2017. 

Please download [the Vox article dataset]( `https://data.world/elenadata/vox-articles` ). You will get the data file named as `dsjVoxArticles.tsv`.

The text data from this data set are collected from original web pages. So there are some html tags . 

To process web data, we should use functions provided by `Beautiful Soup` libarary. Please run the code written in the jupyter notebook `VoxDataPrepare.ipynb` to process the data. In the end, a data file named `VoxData.csv` will be generated without html tags. 

### Tasks

Detailed tasks are described in the `Vox.ipynb`. Please finish your report in that jupyter notebook.
